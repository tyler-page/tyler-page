# About
Hi there, I'm Tyler, I'm Autistic and I have started my journey of learning how to code and hopefully begin a career in the Software Development Industry.

I am good with computers and have always been interested in them since I was young. I am enjoying my CYF journey at the moment and learning more about HTML, CSS and JS.
